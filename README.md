You can choose a specific time interval and break time which perfects for you. For now, there are only a limited number of options, but the app will support direct time input in the future. 

Time interval - time in minutes to work on the computer before notification about break will be generated.

Break time - time in minutes to rest your eyes.

The app is built using ```SwiftUI``` and requires macOS 10.15 to run.
